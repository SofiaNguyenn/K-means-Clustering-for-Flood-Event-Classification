# K-means-Clustering-for-Flood-Event-Classification
This projects uses K-means clustering in an unsupervised learning method to classify flood events based on key attributes like rainfall and location, all the data is numerical . By used Google colab  for computational efficiency and Weka for data preprocessing , aims to create the distinct clusters to aid in flood wanrning and management.

# Using Elbow method for optimal value of k in KMeans
